## 0.2.2, 2026-10-04

- **`npx -y @thenavidm/google-workspace-mcp-cli` always starts the MCP server.** npx starts whichever binary the npm registry lists first when they share one file, and the registry does not keep the published order, so an MCP client set up with this README's install line could get `google-workspace-cli` and its command list instead of a server. A third binary named after the package now always starts the server, and npx picks it by name.

## 0.2.1

**A refusal says `--confirm` in a terminal.** The server words it for an AI, as `confirm: true`, and the CLI now rewrites that one phrase, so the command it asks for is the one you type. The command list only mentions `--confirm` where a tool takes it.

**The README shows the context cost measured in Claude Code**: every tool loaded, Claude Code's default tool search, and the CLI's `SKILL.md`, each from 2 real runs.

## 0.2.0

**A CLI.** `google-workspace-cli` runs every tool as a shell command. It builds the same server the MCP binary runs and calls it through the SDK's in-memory transport, so the flags, the validation and the write guard are the ones an MCP app gets, and the two surfaces cannot drift. Exit codes follow the house contract: 2 usage or a refused write, 3 not found, 4 auth, 5 API, 7 rate limited, 10 nothing configured.

**Renamed to google-workspace-mcp-cli**, the name every server with a CLI carries. The old package is deprecated with a pointer here, and GitHub redirects the old repo address.

**A Claude Desktop extension**, attached to each release.

**Tests and CI.** The repo had neither. The CLI's tests run against the real tool list, and CI checks the CLI lists all 38 tools.

Checked against a live account before release: the MCP tool list is byte-identical to 0.1.0's, and Calendar, Gmail and Drive answer through both surfaces.

## 0.1.0

First release.

### What it does

38 tools across Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Tasks, Forms and
Contacts, over stdio and streamable HTTP.

### Why it wraps Google's CLI

Reading a mailbox needs `gmail.modify` and full Drive needs `drive`. Google
classes both as restricted, so any OAuth app declaring them faces an annual
third-party security assessment and a 100-user cap until it passes.

Google's Workspace CLI already handles authentication. Wrapping it means this
server never holds a Google credential, and the user's own login carries the
scopes.

### Notable

- 38 curated tools rather than the CLI's ~400 methods, plus `workspace_raw` and
  `workspace_schema` for everything else
- Email is drafted, never sent silently. Sending is a separate confirmed tool
- No permanent delete. `drive_trash` is recoverable for 30 days
- `GWS_READ_ONLY=1` and `GWS_SERVICES=` narrow the surface, removing tools from
  the list rather than failing when called
- `--http` refuses to start without a bearer token
- Arguments reach the CLI as an array, never a shell. Email headers reject CR/LF
- `deploy/install.sh` for systemd, and a Dockerfile pinned to a digest with the
  gws binary checksum-verified

### Verified at build time

- MCP TypeScript SDK 1.30.0, zod 4.5.4, Node 22
- Google Workspace CLI v0.22.5
- The CLI ships no OAuth client of its own, so a login uses yours. An unverified
  app in production still works: you click past one warning screen
- `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file` avoids the OS keyring, which is
  what makes headless servers work
