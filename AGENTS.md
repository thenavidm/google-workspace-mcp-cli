# Working on google-workspace-mcp-cli

For agents editing this repository. Users read the README.

## What this is

An MCP server that wraps Google's own Workspace CLI rather than calling the REST
APIs. That choice is the whole design: the CLI owns authentication, so this
server never handles a Google credential, and it is generated from Google's
discovery service, so a new API method works here without a release from us.

## Non-negotiables

**Every tool goes through `gws()` in `src/gws.ts`.** Arguments are passed as an
array, never through a shell. A subject line containing a semicolon must not be
able to become a command.

**Email is drafted, not sent.** `gmail_create_draft` writes to Drafts and stops.
Do not add a tool that composes and sends in one call, however convenient.

**Confirmation only on what cannot be undone.** Sending email, deleting a
calendar event, trashing a file, and a raw method that deletes. Slipway asks for
it from the `DESTRUCTIVE` annotation, and `src/tools/kit.ts` holds each one's
refusal words. Not on labels, not on writes that can be
edited back. Requiring confirmation everywhere teaches the model to pass it
reflexively, and then it passes it on the delete too.

**No permanent delete.** `drive_trash` sets `trashed: true`. If someone asks for
a hard delete, they can use `workspace_raw` and mean it.

**Built on Slipway.** `src/app.ts` describes the server; `src/tools/kit.ts`
records each `registerTool` call and turns it into a Slipway tool in its
service's toolset, so `GWS_SERVICES` picks the toolsets and Slipway hides the
writes under `GWS_READ_ONLY`, keeping `workspace_raw` for its reads with
`whenReadOnly: "reads"`.

**`guard()` first, before any work.** It refuses a service `GWS_SERVICES` leaves
out, which only `workspace_raw` can still name.

## The tool surface is curated on purpose

The CLI reaches roughly 400 methods. This server exposes 38. That is not an
oversight: a model choosing from 400 tools chooses badly, and the whole list is
re-sent on every turn. `workspace_raw` plus `workspace_schema` cover the rest,
so curation costs nothing in capability.

Before adding a tool, ask whether it is something an assistant reaches for
often. If not, it belongs behind `workspace_raw`.

## Testing

```bash
npm run build
npm test
node dist/index.js doctor
```

`doctor` makes a live API call, so it needs a real login. The unit tests do not.

To test the tool list end to end, run the server over stdio and call
`tools/list`. It should return 38.

## Writing

No em dashes. Short paragraphs. Comments explain why, not what. Tool
descriptions are read by a model that cannot see the code, so they state what
the tool reaches, what it costs, and what will surprise the caller.
